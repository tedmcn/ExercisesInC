# Exercise 3
## Creating small tools


1) Read [the man page for the UNIX command tee](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/tee.1.html).  
And [the Wikipedia page about it](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tee_(command)).

2) Write an implementation of `tee` that takes the same command-line
arguments (short form only, or for optional extra fun, both long and
short form).  Implementing the `-i` option is optional.

This is meant as an exercise in efficient C development, which includes:

a) Problem decomposition: what pieces do I need?

b) Solution location: mostly Google->stackoverflow.

c) Assimilation: bringing in the pieces and testing them.

d) Integration: putting the pieces together. 

For this particular problem, we could skip (a) and just find a
solution.  But let's take this as an opportunity to practice.

3) Reflect: what worked, what slowed you down?  What would you do
differently next time?

4) Compare your solution to the real thing.  What do you see in
professional code that is not in your solution?

5) Write comments in the code to answer the last two questions, then
check it in to the repo.
