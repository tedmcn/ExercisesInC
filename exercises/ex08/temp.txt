CHAPTER
I
We
all
have
our
dreams
Without
them
we
should
be
clods
It
is
in
dreams
that
we
accomplish
the
impossible
rich
man
dumps
his
load
of
responsibility
and
lives
in
a
log
shack
on
mountain
top
the
poor
man
becomes
rich
stay
at
home
travels
wanderer
finds
an
abiding
place
more
years
than
I
like
to
recall
my
dream
has
been
cruise
through
the
South
Islands
in
my
own
ship
and
if
you
had
ever
been
to
South
Sea
Islands
it
would
be
yours
also
They
are
the
sole
remaining
spot
on
this
earth
that
is
not
infested
with
big
game
shooting
expeditions
globe
trotters
or
profiteers
where
the
inhabitants
know
how
to
live
and
where
the
unfortunate
from
distant
turbulent
lands
can
still
find
interest
enjoyment
peace
My
dream
was
as
impracticable
most
There
a
war
to
be
attended
to
and
lived
through
if
Providence
so
willed
There
was
a
ship
be
bought
fitted
out
and
provisioned
on
a
bank
balance
that
would
fill
the
modern
cat’s
meat
man
with
contempt
There
were
little
matters
cramming
into
a
chronically
unmathematical
head
sufficient
knowledge
navigation
steer
such
a
ship
across
world
when
she
was
and
of
finding
a
crew
that
would
work
her
without
hope
monetary
reward
thing
looked
sounded
sufficiently
like
comic
opera
to
deter
me
from
mentioning
it
to
any
but
a
select
few
and
they
laughed
Yet
such
is
driving
power
a
dream
if
its
fulfilment
sufficiently
desired
that
I
write
in
retrospect
with
my
vision
secure
and
accomplished
fact
Exactly
how
it
all
came
about
I
find
difficult
to
recall
have
vague
recollections
of
crouching
in
dug
outs
France
and
while
others
had
recourse
during
their
leisure
to
letter
cases
replete
with
photographs
of
fluffy
girls
I
pored
with
equal
interest
over
plans
and
designs
of
my
dream
ship
hospital
it
was
same
and
when
a
medical
board
politely
ushered
me
into
street
a
free
man
it
took
rather
less
than
four
hours
to
reach
the
nearest
seaport
commence
search
that
covered
best
part
of
six
months
It
is
no
easy
matter
to
find
counterpart
of
a
dream
ship
but
in
end
I
found
her
patiently
awaiting
me
a
backwater
of
glorious
Devon
—a
Norwegian
built
auxiliary
cutter
of
twenty
three
tons
register
designed
as
a
lifeboat
for
the
North
Sea
fishing
fleet
forty
seven
feet
over
all
fifteen
feet
beam
eight
draught
built
stand
up
anything
and
be
handled
by
crew
of
three
or
less
Such
was
my
dream
ship
in
cold
print
In
reality
and
seen
through
her
owner’s
eyes
she
was
naturally
the
most
wonderful
thing
that
ever
happened
A
mother
on
the
subject
her
child
is
almost
derogatory
compared
with
an
owner
concerning
his
ship
so
reader
shall
be
spared
further
details
Having
found
her
there
was
little
matter
of
paying
for
I
had
no
money
I
have
never
had
any
but
that
is
a
detail
should
never
be
allowed
to
stand
the
way
of
a
really
desirable
dream
It
necessary
make
some
How
By
conducting
stubborn
offensive
on
Army
Authorities
for
war
gratuity
By
sitting
up
to
all
in
a
moth

flat
writing
short
stories
By
assiduously
cultivating
maiden
aunts

refuse

dream
ship
became
mine
but
what
crew
Well
I
have
sister
and
a
sister
is
an
uncommonly
handy
thing
to
have
provided
she
of
right
variety
Mine
happens
to
be
for
she
agreed

all
delicacies

season
and

So

on
hearing
these
same

offered

services
with
almost
unbecoming
alacrity

for
those
unacquainted
with
the
intricacies
ocean
cruising
may
imagine
there
was
nothing
more
to
be
done
than
to
sail
Others
who
have
perhaps
trodden
thorny
path
leading
to
the
fulfilment
such
as
ours
will
realize
that
our
troubles
had
little
more
than
begun
The
hull
of
ship—even
dream
ship—is
a
thing
vastly
different
from
vessel
fully
equipped
for
voyage
The
difference
between
house
furnished
unfurnished
is
nothing
it
We
needed
an
auxiliary
motor
engine
for
entering
and
leaving
port
if
we
would
escape
extortionate
towage
charges
We
needed
copper
sheathing
protect
our
future
home
against
the
dreaded
cobra
worm
tropical
waters
that
has
been
known
to
reduce
sound
wood
the
semblance
a
honeycomb
within
six
months
We
needed
water
tanks
contain
three
hundred
gallons
oil
tanks
hold
two
nautical
instruments
and
gear
of
every
possible
description
not
mention
provisions
for
an
indefinite
period
were
to
acquire
these
things
without
proverbial
penny
to
do
it
with
was
a
problem
that
gave
us
pause
until
an
extraordinary
general
meeting
of
firm
Peter
Steve
and
Myself
dream
merchants
it
was
proposed
seconded
carried
unanimously
that
we
suffered
from
lack

which
he
has
never
divulged
to
this
day
though
judging
by
its
success
I
am
divided
my
surmise
to
nature
between
bridge
and
robbery
with
violence
As
for
me

but

I

The
answer
caused
me
furiously
to
think
There
were
a
hundred
fifty
sailing
vessels
in
this
old
fashioned
Devonshire
fishing
fleet
each
earning
handsome
income
and
not
one
of
them
better
craft
than
mine
Why
not
go
trawling

I
did
propose
to
give
brief
account
of
my
experiences
for
benefit

of
The

far
famed
hostelry
replete
with

learnt
that
the
universal
custom
amongst
fishing
craft
thereabouts
was
have
a
crew
of
three
two
hands
and
skipper
The
money
that

realized
on

was
divided
at
the

But

too
heavy

invented

everything
that
could

was
matter

to
these
chronically
pessimistic
gentry
She
too
much
freeboard
She
beam
for
her
length
Her
bulwarks
were
not
high
enough
She
would
never
tow

Yet
upon
never
be
forgotten
morning
we
sailed—dearly
beloved
word
infinite
possibilities
—we
sailed
at
a
seven
knot
clip
for
precisely
ten
miles
We
could
beat
ketch
rigged
smacks
of
fleet
wind’ard
without
topsail
or
staysail
I
grinned
boy
even

grinned
as
he
looked
aloft
it
at
precise
moment
that
saw
grin
fade
into
an
open
mouthed
wide
eyed
stare
She’s
gone
at
eyes
rigging
was
all
he
said
complete
composure
in
rich
Devonian
put
about
The
mast
head
was
leaning
at
an
angle
degrees
wabbling
its
splintered
base
like
drunken
The
hand
in
white
chin
whiskers
enormous
boots
bowler
hat
dented
on
one
side
continued
to
grin
In
that
hour
hated
To
him
it
was
a
gigantic
joke
amusing
problem
as
to
whether
we
could
reach
harbour
before
mast
fell
about
our
ears
To
me
owner
of
dream
ship
it
was
tragedy
There
moments
when
even
a
sense
humour
can
out
place
One
hundred
yards
from
our
moorings
the
mast
went
at
deck
as
well
as
the
hounds
fell
with
crash
full
length
ship—without
touching
soul
It
was
little
short
of
miracle
few
moments
we
stood
in
our
several
places
pondering
it
mast
scarce
met
the
deck
with
sails
and
rigging
hanging
side
in
tangled
mass
smack’s
crew
was
alongside
Did
want
help
did
but
hardly
expected
such
stiff
bill
for
salvage
rendered
the
next
day
took
weeks
step
dream
ship’s
new
mast
miserable
weeks
waiting
that
only
those
who
have
fitted
out
can
appreciate
But
in
time
sailed
afresh
We
even
launched
trawl
much
shouting
flurry
at
end
two
hours’
speculation
hauled
it
up
again
sheer
brawn
capstan
got
net
aboard
found
mud
nothing
but
cod
end
Various
explanations
were
forthcoming
from
hand
this
calamity
There
was
too
much
lead
on
foot
rope
cork
head
line
otter
boards
were
not
slung
true
We
had
been
towing
too
fast
We
had
been
slow
Why
bless
your
heart
there
were
men
successful
fishermen
now
who
had
spent
months
in
adjusting
an
otter
trawl
An
inch
this
way
that
made
all
difference
An
otter
trawl
was
like
watch
Out
all
this
hard
fact
emerged
that
we
caught
no
fish
Fisherman
two
weeks
we
were
out
early
and
late
experimenting
I
scraped
together
Heaven
knows
how
sufficient
hand’s
retainer
and
my
own
board
lodging
And
then—success
came
us
as
a
miracle
Instead
of
mud
or
shells
weed
we
found
fish
cod
end
fat
plaice
luxurious
sole
skate
whiting
What
we
had
done
otter
trawl
I
don’t
think
anyone
knew
least
of
all
the
hand
am
none
wiser
to
this
day
but
it
caught
fish
treasured
trawl
as
something
exceedingly
precious
nothing
whatsoever
would
cause
us
to
alter
its
ropes
or
leads
a
hair’s
breadth
We
lived
constant
dread
that
we
should
meet
hitch
an
obstacle
on
bottom
that
would
make
it
necessary
cut
warp
lose
this
wonderful
It
would
have
taken
two
weeks
perhaps
two
discover
another
like
it
we
were
averaging
fifty
pounds
week
Success
breeds
ambition
installed
motor
auxiliary
engine
Further
there
is
only
one
way
of
catching
more
fish
than
by
trawling
day
trawling
night
The
fish
especially
whiting
do
not
see
net
coming
dark
So
we
acquired
habits
of
night
hawks
sailing
at
four
o’clock
in
the
afternoon
and
returning
six
the
next
morning
It
paid
handsomely
What
should
not
be
able
report
at
next
general
meeting
dream
merchants
a
fine
sight
on
pitch
black
night
see
our
wake
streaming
away
like
smoke
from
propeller
so
bright
with
phosphorescence
that
seemed
a
powerful
light
must
be
hung
over
stern
And
to
watch
net
lit
with
myriad
tiny
lamps
creeping
yard
by
Then
what
a
splashing
as
big
skate
plaice
came
alongside
must
be
remembered
ship’s
career
a
fishing
smack
during
last
phases
of
great
war
She
saw
German
submarines
two
steamers
sunk
had
her
stalwart
ribs
severely
shaken
depth
charges
on
several
occasions
In
fact
as
one
concussion
caused
her
to
leak
had
serious
thoughts
decorating
with
a
wound
stripe
starboard
quarter
What
effect
of
one
those
fearful
implements
of
destruction
must
be
at
close
quarters
while
submerged
can
hardly
imagine
only
know
that
one
dropped
about
half
mile
dream
ship
cabin
sounded
as
though
someone
hit
oil
tanks
with
sledge
hammer
felt
as
though
she
had
run
bow
on
at
a
nine
knot
clip
into
an
iceberg
Over
twenty
good
sound
fishing
smacks
belonging
to
fleet
which
sailed
were
sent
bottom
German
submarines
In

a

Warps

This

And

The

Perhaps
yet
am
convinced
without

most
certainly
ignorance
we
should
never
have
set

much
won
through
our
goal
transition
from
fancy
fact
was
effected
following
morning
Steve
commenced
soul
racking
task
transferring
twelve
tons
rusty
pig
iron
from
the
bilge
to
quay
alongside
which
we
lay
This
mass
of
obstinate
metal
had
to
be
chipped
painted
ultimately
replaced
so
might
disport

we
sat

no

By

said
evening
when
weary

we
flung
ourselves
on

according

this
where
study

isn’t
it
And
for
three
mortal
hours
he
gave
his
undivided

nautical
epitome
That
kind
of
man
Steve
There
is
no
undertaking
requires
careful
selection
personnel
than
cruise
such
as
we
contemplated
no
better
opportunity
taking
a
man’s
measure
than
when
fitting
out
By
time
it
is
done
one
has
either
come
conclusion
that
other
fellow
has
points
or
that
to
remain
company
another
hour
endurance
Naturally
his
feelings
are
similar
and
we
stood
mutual
test
seemed
me
augur
well
future
during
this
trying
period
that
encountered
peculiarly
pernicious
type
the
genus
yachtsman
on
his
native
heath
He
was
owner
pretty
little
six
tonner
across
creek
and
fitting
also—had
been
months
as
far
we
could
gather
The
thing
evidently
a
hobby
with
him
he
infinitely
preferred
getting
sea
With
paint
pot
one
hand
camel’s
hair
brush
other
he
advanced
on
his
craft
in
the
manner
an
artist
attacking
master
canvas
applied
the
pigment
stood
back
with
his
head
at
angle
view
effect
In
itself
there
nothing
against
this
form
amusement
provided
that
it
interfered
no
one
else
but
evidently
tiring
his
own
company
at
which
I
am
surprised
our
yachtsman
strolled
direction
dream
ship
to
offer
unsolicited
criticism

short
most
things
about

met
yachtsman’s
hearty

To
which
I
was
constrained

with
all

defects

I

not

This

Perhaps

deserted

we
were
awed
by
a

of

lay

Such

Indeed
